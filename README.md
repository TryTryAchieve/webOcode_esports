I was facing a lot of problem in making the navigation responsive and side by side make it aesthetic, this issue was resolved by making navigation bar as hamburger menu as soon as a certain width is achieved.
Moreover, I found it difficult to align the form labels and inputbox, this issue was resolved by keeping them in different divisons.   
I learnt some important basics for creating a responsive footer with different sections and how to make a slideshow using javascript.
